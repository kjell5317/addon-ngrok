# Ngrok & Freenom

## Deprecation Notice

There is [a new addon](https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared) which has similar features but uses cloudflared so the domains are automaticly updated without cloaking which is a lot more comfortable. Pleas use cloudflared instead of this addon.

## Description

This addon creates a Ngrok tunnel to your Home Assistant instance and forwards your Freenom domain to the tunnel endpoint so you don't have to worry about changing tunnel domains.
